## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a new issue in this repository for every suspected vulnerability. Each report must include:

- A clear description of the problem and what you observed.
- Impact assessment and affected components or versions if known.
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions so we can verify the issue.
- Any logs, proof-of-concept snippets, or screenshots that help illustrate the vulnerability.

Do not bundle multiple vulnerabilities in a single issue; file one issue per vulnerability so we can triage and fix efficiently.
