## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a [new issue](https://github.com/batleforc/ProxyAuthK8S/issues/new?template=security_vulnerability_report.md) in this repository for every suspected vulnerability. Each report must include:

- A clear description of the problem and what you observed.
- Impact assessment and affected components or versions if known.
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions so we can verify the issue.
- Any logs, proof-of-concept snippets, or screenshots that help illustrate the vulnerability.

Do not bundle multiple vulnerabilities in a single issue; file one issue per vulnerability so we can triage and fix efficiently.

To protect sensitive information, please avoid including secrets, personal data, or confidential details in your report. If you need to share sensitive information, please contact us directly.
